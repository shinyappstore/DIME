# DIME: A Gateway to Disease-Gene Networks

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/DIME](https://shinyappstore.com/a/DIME)__

DIME, an app for assessing the impact of disease genes on immune cells, employs non-negative matrix factorization to identify clusters of disease-associated cells (DAC) expressing disease-associated genes (DAG). DIME network integrates with DisGeNet network, offering a comprehensive analysis. DIME, standing for Disease-gene IMmune cell Expression network, enables the study of cell-specific disease mechanisms and identifies common DACs and top-weighted DAGs between disease pairs, defining a shared cell-gene network. Additionally, DIME aids in identifying drug repurposing targets and determining top genes and cells associated with diseases from DisGeNet, EBI GWAS, or user-defined gene sets. It explores the cumulative effect of disease-associated genes on immune functions, integrating disease gene networks with transcriptome profiles of 40 immune cells to generate a comprehensive Disease-gene IMmune cell Expression network.
